DimensioneX is an easy, free multiplayer (MMORPG) game engine. Designed for developing and running multiplayer adventure games, it is also a valuable resource for beginners to learn computer programming.

Once you have it working on your PC or on a web server you can easily develop a web-based massive multiplayer game with the scenes and characters you want. It will mostly produce 2D or pseudo-3D first person or third person games.

Visitors will explore your games and worlds without downloading any client software – everything you create with DimensioneX is browser based.

Games can even be embedded in any web page.

A game play is better than 1000 words. [Play our demos first](https://www.dimensionex.net/play-online-now/) – our games showcase here and more demos!
