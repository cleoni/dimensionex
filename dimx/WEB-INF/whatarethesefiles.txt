These XML files are "web application descriptors".

Simply put, they tell your Tomcat web server where to get DimensioneX files and what their URL will be.

Please select the appropriate file for your own web server version and rename it to WEB.XML

The DimensioneX kit comes pre-configured for tomcat 7 - 8

For doubts, go to the DimensioneX website and click on the Support section.
